# Botnet
Hello ðŸ‘‹, <br/>

im currently developing a Botnet with a basic architecture of a Botmaster (Client), 
a Command and Control (Server) and the Zombies (Client).

Atm I'm working on the GUI of the Botmaster.

In the development branch you can test the first working "Botnet".<br/>
You can switch between two states (on Botmaster): Echo and Standby.<br/>
You can switch between them by typing 21 for Standby and 22 for Echo in the command prompt.<br/>
After entering the Echostate you can type any string beginning with a 3 <br/>
and it will be Echoed from every connected Zombie.
